Equations:
  HP = Torque * RPM % 5252
  1HP = 33,000 ft*lbs/min

Car Specs:
  Max power: 140 hp (105 kW) at 5600 rpm
  Max torque: 152 lbÂ·ft (206 Nm) at 4400 rpm
  Weight (of system) = 3600 lbs

  Gear Ratios:
    KA24(D)E & SR20DET (S13/S14):
    1st- 3.321
    2nd- 1.902
    3rd- 1.308
    4th- 1.000
    5th- 0.759

With the Nissan, 3000 rpm seems to be some sort of sweet spot...

So I know what the rpms are, but I do not know the HP and the torque.

Convert miles/hour to ft/min:
  miles/hour * (1/60 hour/min) * (5280 ft/mile) = 88 ft/min

But what is the thing that I'm trying to figure out here? Am I trying to find the... power that is required
to move the car...?

  This is going to be a model of driving my car up a hill, a system widely encountered with different vehicles.

  I suppose there are a couple different parts to this project, I've been mostly thinking about the back end
  calculations and still don't fully understand the relationship between torque/hp/rpms but that's not something that's really a problem.
  It would be great if these calculations could be super specific but then again, there's also the front end to work on. It should mostly
  be pretty straight forward...

  The Game of Equilibrium!
    This is kind of a difficult concept to wrap my head around, we're going to be looking at the total acceleration here and it's kind of
    an interesting thing.

  Thinking about wanting to show the change in velocity as the object moves up/down the ramp.
  But all that is doing is showing the acceleration. So that's is an interesting thing to consider.
  I guess it's an interesting thing because of how...

  Acceleration is an increase of speed over time.

  We have acc, vel, and angle.

  The angle will be a known variable, so it is subject to change in time
  both acc. and vel are dependent

  acc = g*sin(a)

  ... so I think I need to find a way to mark time, that must start when there is an inflection point... which happens when the

  Um... I'm just a little confused here and trying to get my thoughts together, so not a big deal or anything.
  I know I need to be looking at the angle at different times...
  Or maybe not? The

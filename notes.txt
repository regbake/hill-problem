Equations:
  HP = Torque * RPM % 5252
  1HP = 33,000 ft*lbs/min

Car Specs:
  Max power: 140 hp (105 kW) at 5600 rpm
  Max torque: 152 lbÂ·ft (206 Nm) at 4400 rpm
  Weight (of system) = 3600 lbs

  Gear Ratios:
    KA24(D)E & SR20DET (S13/S14):
    1st- 3.321
    2nd- 1.902
    3rd- 1.308
    4th- 1.000
    5th- 0.759

With the Nissan, 3000 rpm seems to be some sort of sweet spot...

So I know what the rpms are, but I do not know the HP and the torque.

Convert miles/hour to ft/min:
  miles/hour * (1/60 hour/min) * (5280 ft/mile) = 88 ft/min

But what is the thing that I'm trying to figure out here? Am I trying to find the... power that is required
to move the car...?
